Regular Expression Practice Questions

Question 1- Write a RegEx pattern in python program to check that a string contains only a certain set of characters (in this case a-z, A-Z and 0-9).
Answer:-  
target_string = "Vir18at@ kohli10$0 has recently surpassed Sach100in Tendulka*r in nunmber of centuries in ODI."
pattern = "V[a-zA-Z0-9at]+@|k[a-zA-Z0-9$]+0|S[a-zA-Z0-9100]+in|T[a-zA-Z0-9*]+r"
result = re.findall(pattern,target_string)
print(result)

Question 2- Write a RegEx pattern that matches a string that has an a followed by zero or more b's
Answer:-  
string = "ab,bc,ba,abbb"
pattern = "^ab*"
result = re.findall(pattern,string)
print(result)

Question 3-  Write a RegEx pattern that matches a string that has an a followed by one or more b's
Answer:- 
string = "ab,bc,ba,abbb,abc"
pattern = "ab+"
result = re.findall(pattern,string)
print(result)

Question 4- Write a RegEx pattern that matches a string that has an a followed by zero or one 'b'.
Answer:- 
string = "ab,bc,ba,abbb,abc"
pattern = "ab?"
result = re.findall(pattern,string)
print(result)

Question 5- Write a RegEx pattern in python program that matches a string that has an a followed by three 'b'.
Answer:- 
string = "abbc,abbb,abcd,abcde"
pattern = "ab{3}"
result = re.search(pattern,string)
print(result)

Question 6- Write a RegEx pattern in python programthat matches a string that has an a followed by two to three 'b'.
Answer:- 
string = "abbc,abbb,abcd,abcde"
pattern = "ab{2,3}"
result = re.findall(pattern,string)
print(result)

Question 7- Write a Python program that matches a string that has an 'a' followed by anything, ending in 'b'.
Answer:- 
string = "afewfb,affew,aiojjb,fre"
pattern = "^a.*b$"
result = re.search(pattern,string)
print(result)

Question 8- Write a RegEx pattern in python program that matches a word at the beginning of a string.
Answer:- 
string = "Rome was not built in oneday"
pattern = "^\w+"
result = re.findall(pattern,string)
print(result)

Question 9- Write a RegEx pattern in python program that matches a word at the end of a string.
Answer:- 
string = "Rome was not built in oneday"
pattern = "\w+$"
result = re.findall(pattern,string)
print(result)

Question 10- Write a RegEx pattern in python program to find all words that are 4 digits long in a string.
Sample text- '01 0132 231875 1458 301 2725.'
Expected output- ['0132', '1458', '2725']
Answer:- 
target = "32325 total runs 05 series of test 96267 was the crowd at 987 lords 35971"
result = re.findall(r'\d{4}',target)
print(result)
